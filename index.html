<h3>About the Plant</h3>
<p>describe the plant, care and stuff here. Describe it as if you are explaing it to someone who cannot see the picture.</p>
<h3>Shipping and Garuntee</h3>
<p>Ground shipping is free! Rushed shipping is availble for an additional $23.00. All plants are shipped with roots exposed as some states do not allow plants to be shipped with dirt attached to the roots. This is perfectly fine! The plant will remain healthy througout transport. If the weather is cold, all plants will be shipped with a heat pack to protect the plants. This often leads to new shoots growing during transport. Some slight damaged may occur during shipping. This is normal and the plant will still be healthy and recover. If your plant seems to have more damamge than expected, reach out to us and we will help!</p>
